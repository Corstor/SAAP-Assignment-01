# EBike Application

## Requirements and specifications

It is required to create an application that allows users to register themselves and then use one of the electric bikes that are on the environment to start a ride, moving the bike's position.

Users can registers themselves and use a bike from a remote GUI, and the administrators can create electric bikes from another remote GUI.

There should be data persistence.

Should be possible to add new functionalities available to the users dynamically.

### My specific requirements

To create persistency, it has been decided to allows the user to save its data, to load its data, and to load and change the electric bikes data (with a ride).

The admin can load, save and change the electric bikes data.

## Architecture

The architecture chosen is a clean architecture
